About this program:

This program is still very young. This is a game I wrote for an "AI in Game Design" course I took at college. It is a fair game, but incomplete. 
Being written in a very short time, it is coded fairly slopily and lacks certain features of a checkers game - like multiple jumps. The AI is simple
 but quite good for what it is. But, it is limited and it shows especially at endgame.

The code is written in C and is built on the curses library. To build, just run 'make' and the executable is 'checkers'. This should build on all UNIX-like systems.


TODO

	* clean up the code base!
	* implement all game rules - i.e. multiple jumps
	* switch from a curses interface to just a console interface 
	  (will make it easier to serve as a backend for a GUI frontend)
	* write a better AI heuristic
	* add move databases
